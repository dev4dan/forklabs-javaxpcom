                                Release Notes


INTRODUCTION

    This library is contains the basic skeleton to make a web crawler using
    the mozilla browser inside a SWT shell. The crawler can control the
    navigation and has access to the underlying DOM rendered by the browser.


USAGE

    The crawler is expected to be subclassed to include the control and
    data mining mechanisms. There is a console example class in src/test/java
    that fires up a browser, navigates to the project page and explores the
    main tabs (Project Home, Downloads, Wiki, ...).


LIMITATIONS

    The distribution includes a version of SWT and XULRunner for Windows. If
    you are to use this library on another operating system, you will have to
    install your own version of SWT and XULRunner and re-link the dependency
    in the POM.

    * http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/

    Also, as with any SWT application, you will have to access the content of
    the underlying DOM inside the SWT thread, usually using the instance
    method Crawler#runOnSWTThread().
